Content Hub Icon Component\n   *\n   * This component displays one of three differente date selectors based on the\n   * users input requirements.\n   *\n   * 1. Date range\n   * 2. Start date only\n   * 3. End date only\n   *\n   * The selected date is sent via an action preserving DDAU.\n   *\n   * ### Usage:\n   *\n   * ```handlebars\n   * {{ch-date-range\n   *   onSelect=(action 'setFilterDate')\n   *   selected=filterDate}}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Options\n   *\n   * * `onSelect` - **(Optional)** Action to fire when a date is selected.\n   * * `selected` - **(Optional)** The currently selected date or date range.\n   *\n   * ### Resulting Date Object\n   *\n   * The date object returned via the `onSelect` action regardless of which mode\n   * is selected will include both a start and end date key. In the event of only\n   * sending either start or end date. The other will be set to `null`\n   *\n   * ```javascript\n   * {\n   *   start: Thu Oct 06 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)\n   *   end: Fri Oct 14 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)\n   * }\n   *\n   *\n   * @class ch-date-range\n   * @extends Ember.Component\n   * @public\n   */\n\n  var dateTemplate = {\n    start: null,\n    end: null\n  };\n\n  exports['default'] = Component.extend({\n\n    /**\n     * (Optional) Currently selected date range.\n     *\n     * @property selected\n     * @optional\n     * @type {Object}\n     * @public\n     */\n    selected: {\n      start: null,\n      end: null\n    },\n\n    classNames: ['ch__cmp__date-range'],\n\n    currentRangeStartDate: computed('dateRange', function () {\n      var now = new Date();\n      var start = this.get('dateRange.start');\n      return start || now;\n    }),\n\n    currentStartDate: computed('dateRange', function () {\n      var now = new Date();\n      var start = this.get('dateRange.start');\n      return start || now;\n    }),\n\n    currentEndDate: computed('dateRange', function () {\n      var now = new Date();\n      var end = this.get('dateRange.end');\n      return end || now;\n    }),\n\n    didReceiveAttrs: function didReceiveAttrs() {\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      var selected = this.get('selected');\n      var dateMode = this.get('_dateMode');\n\n      if (!dateMode || selected.start || selected.end) {\n        if (selected.start && !selected.end) {\n          this.set('_dateMode', 'start');\n        } else if (selected.end && !selected.start) {\n          this.set('_dateMode', 'end');\n        } else {\n          this.set('_dateMode', 'range');\n        }\n      }\n      this.set('dateRange', copy(selected));\n    },\n\n    actions: {\n      setFilterDate: function setFilterDate(date) {\n        var dateRange = copy(dateTemplate);\n        var dateMode = this.get('_dateMode');\n\n        if (dateMode === 'range' && !date.date.end) {\n          this.set('dateRange', date.date);\n          return;\n        }\n\n        switch (dateMode) {\n          case 'range':\n            dateRange = date.date;\n            break;\n          case 'start':\n            dateRange.start = date.date;\n            break;\n          case 'end':\n            dateRange.end = date.date;\n            break;\n        }\n        this.sendAction('onSelect', dateRange);\n      },\n      setFilterDateMode: function setFilterDateMode(mode) {\n        var template = copy(dateTemplate);\n        this.set('_dateMode', mode);\n        this.sendAction('onSelect', template);\n      }\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * (Private) The current mode of the range selector.
