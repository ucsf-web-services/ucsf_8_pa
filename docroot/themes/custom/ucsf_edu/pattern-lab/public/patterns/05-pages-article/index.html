    <p>A staggering 64,000 people in the United States died in 2016 from drug overdoses, marking a 22 percent rise from the previous year of a cause of death that now annually exceeds those caused by motor vehicle accidents and gun violence.</p>

    <p>The primary driver of the drug overdose crisis is the ongoing opioid epidemic, which claims the lives of more than 115 people in the country every day, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>

    <p>“The level of death and despair in certain parts of the country is unfathomable,” said UC San Francisco’s Daniel Ciccarone, MD, MPH.</p>

    <p>One of the major hurdles to curbing the epidemic is putting exact figures on the number of overdoses, how many overdoses lead to death, and the type of opioids being used.</p>

    <p>Nationwide, several health agencies are working to collect more information about overdoses and deaths, including one that sends researchers directly into the communities stricken by opioid abuse. This in-the-field research is part of the Heroin in Transition study, led by Ciccarone.</p>

    <p>The five-year study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, is gathering statistical data on opioid use patterns in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the changes in the heroin supply and resulting harms.</p>

    <p>But just as importantly, the study also sends researchers, including Ciccarone, into the field to get to know and truly understand the behavior of opioid users.</p>

    <p>Upon its conclusion in 2019, the Heroin in Transition study could end up providing the much-needed data and big picture view of the epidemic to help bring about positive change, both in policy, such as new laws requiring mental health parity and better access to services, as well as more intimate changes at the ground level, like locally tailored treatment programs.</p>

    <h2>A Triple-Wave Epidemic of Historic Proportions</h2>

    <p>Today, the majority of accidental overdose deaths in the U.S are caused by opioids – the class of drugs that includes the illegal drug heroin, along with prescription pain relievers and illicitly manufactured synthetic derivatives.</p>

    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tallied more than 42,000 opioid-related deaths in 2016, accounting for 66 percent of total overdose fatalities. And with the number of opioid users doubling since 2008, that number is likely to continue to climb. </p>

    <p>“The number of deaths is staggering, but we have to underline all of this through the lens of dependency,” Ciccarone said. “When you become dependent on a substance in such a way that your brain develops new, sometimes bizarre behavioral patterns, your brain is no longer normal. It is a sick organ that needs to be thought of in the same way as any other organ. People with substance use disorders deserve treatment for their illness.”</p>

    <aside class="callout-left">
      <h3 class="callout-left__title">What are opioids?</h3>
      <p>Opioids are natural or synthetic chemicals that interact with opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain, and reduce the intensity of pain signals and feelings of pain.</p>

      <p>The class of drugs includes the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and pain medications available legally by prescription, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine and morphine.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>In an editorial accompanying an August 2017 special section in the International Journal of Drug Policy devoted to the opioid epidemic, Ciccarone explored how the supply of heroin into the United States has changed over time, leading to a crisis of historic proportions that he refers to as a “triple wave epidemic.”</p>

    <p>The foundational base of the crisis, according to the editorial, was the prescription painkiller epidemic, in which powerful opiates were prescribed at alarming rates, causing mass dependency issues that continue today.</p>

    <p>From there, a second wave made landfall in 2010 as former prescription drug patients and other new users came into heroin use, leading to a tripling of heroin-related overdoses since then.</p>

    <p>The third and perhaps most devastating wave of the tsunami – as Ciccarone describes it – arrived in the form of new, and alarmingly powerful synthetic opioids.</p>

    <p>“We are absolutely in a crisis of fentanyl related overdose,” he said. “When I talk to a gentleman in West Virginia who’s lost half his high school class, when I talk to folks that say everybody knows somebody who’s died in the three months from overdose, you get to see that it’s affecting people in a very deep and despairing way.”</p>

    <h2>The Proliferation of Fentanyl</h2>

    <p>Approximately 40 times stronger than regular street heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl first infiltrated the black-market drug supply in 2014. Compared to heroin, which is naturally derived from opium poppy plants and somewhat cumbersome to manufacture, fentanyl can be produced with greater ease and at a lower cost.</p>

    <p>The consequences of the drug’s spread are devastating. In one year’s time from 2015 to 2016, fentanyl-related deaths more than doubled in the United States. Over a three-year period, from 2014 through 2016, deaths from synthetic opioids rose an astounding 540 percent, from an estimated 3,000 to 20,000.</p>

    <h2>A Multidisciplinary Research Approach</h2>

    <p>When Ciccarone first saw hints of the third, fentanyl-propelled wave of the opioid epidemic, he was propelled to apply for grant funding for his latest research project. Now in its fourth of five years, the Heroin in Transition study uses multiple research methods to examine the rising use of novel forms of heroin, changing drug markets and resulting medical problems and social costs.</p>

    <p>The quantitative side of the study focuses on collecting statistical data on toxicology, drug sources and overdose patterns. However, according to Sarah Mars, PhD, the study’s qualitative project director, numbers can only tell part of the story.</p>

    <p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the lives of users, Mars and Ciccarone have spent many hours in cities around the country talking with opioid users and observing them preparing and using the drugs.</p>

    <h2>Deaths from Overdose</h2>

    <p>“Data clearly show that fentanyl carries a far greater risk of overdose than heroin, which is itself riskier than prescription opioids,” said Phillip Coffin, MD, director of substance use research at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. “We created this crisis with an overreliance on opioids, and it will remain with us for at least a generation – there is no quick fix.”</p>

    <p>This qualitative approach is particularly helpful for understanding how users perceive the heightened risks associated with fentanyl.</p>

    <p>“The perspectives of heroin users, the people most directly affected by the opioid crisis, are often overlooked,” Mars said. “They are the ones who monitor the heroin supply on a daily basis and are acutely attuned to changes in potency, adulterants and the appearance of the drugs they use.”</p>

    <h2>From Studying HIV to Heroin</h2>

    <p>In 1989, Ciccarone, a young family physician and lifelong New Yorker, moved cross-country to San Francisco for two reasons. The first was to attend UCSF’s acclaimed Family and Community Medicine Residency Program at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. The second was another epidemic.</p>

    <p>As a medical student, Ciccarone witnessed the terrible impact HIV was having on the New York community and the poor treatment of some HIV patients in the early days of the HIV/AIDS crisis. He saw a better model of care in San Francisco and was inspired to jump in.</p>

    <p>Ciccarone was among a large influx of enthusiastic doctors and researchers who came to San Francisco to study HIV, and he soon realized that to be successful, he would need to carve out a professional niche for himself. He became involved with the injection drug use side of the HIV equation.</p>

<div class="page_narrow">
    <p>“HIV in the early days, was stereotyped into two risk populations: a sexual-risk pool population and an injection-risk pool population,” Ciccarone said. “I found that the population that took on drug use related risk was understudied and stigmatized and so it was a natural draw for me.”</p>

    <p>Now a renowned public health researcher, Ciccarone has spent the last 18 years trying to crack the code of the ongoing, intertwined heroin and opioid crises in the United States. Although Ciccarone speaks candidly about the bleakness of the opioid crisis, he remains hopeful.</p>

    <p>“What we really need is a robust federal public health and policy response to this crisis, and so far we're still in the contemplation phase of that,” he said.</p>

    <p>On smaller scales, proven interventions, like supervised injection facilities and the medication naloxone, which reverses overdose symptoms, have helped save lives. These, Ciccarone said, can save even more people if made more widely available.</p>

    <p>Cindy was cradling her 9-month-old son, Elias, against her chest when she and a room full of family simultaneously yelled “Surprise!” to an unsuspecting aunt on her birthday. The outburst shot like a bolt of electricity through Elias. He cried for an hour.</p>

    <p>Xander, while growing up in the perpetual sensory assault of Manhattan, had to get off the train any time someone with a guitar entered his subway car to play for small change.</p>

    <p>Cal had a more enigmatic reaction to stimuli. His mother, Jennifer, points to the floor-to-ceiling windows in her hilltop living room. Rooftops, forests, and the San Francisco Bay spool out for miles. Cal was 2 when they moved here from a small, contained apartment. “We got here and Cal was always running away from me,” recalls Jennifer. “He suddenly had all this space and stimulation. He was in sensory overload.”</p>

    <h2>Beyond Nails-On-A-Chalkboard</h2>

    <p>Elias, Xander, and Cal all experience extreme reactivity to tactile, auditory, or visual stimulation – a condition known as sensory processing disorder (SPD). Tactile triggers that torment kids with SPD include tags in shirts, wooly sweaters, socks, or an accidental shoulder brush during preschool circle time. Auditory offenses include coffee grinders, the birthday song – surprise or not – and noisy, erratically moving toys. Visual provocations that can set kids off include IMAX movies, crowded stadiums, parking lots, even bikes and tents hanging from the ceiling of a camping store. Whether seen, heard, or felt, what all these sensory inputs have in common is their sudden onset and unpredictability. For an SPD kid, these experiences are beyond a nails-on-a-chalkboard annoyance.</p>

    <p>“As soon as these kids can move themselves, they will run screaming from the room when these stimuli reach their world,” says Elysa Marco, MD ’00, a cognitive and behavioral pediatric neurologist at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. Take Xander, who is now 14. He would rather be kicked in his hapkido martial arts class than receive a friendly hug. “It physically hurts when people hug me,” he says. This makes his mom, Judy, who is a hugger, think twice before reflexively going in for a hug. And Elias, at age 2, would hold his breath and sit at the bottom of the pool – the silence and water pressure his only solace.</p>

    <p>Living in a state of perpetual flight, fight, or freeze in reaction to stimuli – or in constant fear of those reactions’ onset – takes a toll on SPD children and their parents alike. The disorder can be profoundly disruptive on every level. As a parent, how do you diaper a child who feels abraded by even a cloth diaper? And if you can’t diaper a child, how do you leave the house, much less go to work? As a preschool teacher, how do you manage a student who falls apart every time a block falls or a tambourine is tapped? And as that student, how do you connect with your classmates when you feel compelled to dart under a table to save yourself from that tumbling block or terrifying tambourine?</p>

    <p>But as life-altering as SPD is for the children and families affected by it, the disorder isn’t included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), clinicians’ touchstone for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. Marco’s professional quest is to build a better understanding of the genetics and the neural underpinnings of sensory-processing differences. It’s clear that sensory overresponsivity is shared by many children with genetic or psychological conditions like autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Indeed, kids with SPD often struggle with more than hypersensitivity: Some 40 percent of kids with an SPD diagnosis also have dysgraphia, meaning they have such poor fine-motor coordination that they have difficulty writing, and 40 percent also have ADHD (these are not necessarily the same 40 percent). While Marco isn’t hung up on labels, she is committed to achieving better understanding and better therapeutic support for children with sensory-based challenges. She’s encouraged by signs that the field is moving past the DSM debate to a more genetic and symptom-based approach to caring for such kids – in their homes, schools, and communities.</p>

    <p>According to Marco, who is also an associate professor of neurology at UCSF and a resident alumna, many SPD kids acquire an autism label along the way, which helps with insurance coverage. And there is overlap in the disorders. Nearly 90 percent of kids with autism also have sensory processing differences – some underresponsivity and some overresponsivity. However, kids with SPD do not usually exhibit the fixated interests, repetitive motions, and social indifference that are hallmarks of autism. “Kids with SPD are wanting to socially engage, they just can’t tolerate it,” explains Marco.</[>]

    <h2>Diagnostic Debate</h2>

    <p>Early in her practice, Marco kept seeing kids with what were described as developmental delays; they often had autism diagnoses, too. “I would want to ask these parents about seizures, walking, and language development, but they wanted to know how they were supposed to wash their kids’ hair when they couldn’t touch their head, or how they could just get them clothed and out the door,” recalls Marco.</p>

    <p>A distinct SPD diagnosis is not without controversy. Some neurologists and pediatricians think SPD is listed exactly where it should be – under autism. Others argue that the condition doesn’t exist at all; for years, clinicians attributed SPD to inadequate parenting. Indeed, every parent of an SPD child has stories of being judged for their parenting by clinicians, loved ones, and strangers alike. “I take Cal to places like a restaurant or party where the volume rises. He just loses it – both imploding and exploding. Or in parking lots, he’ll just sit down,” says Jennifer. “In these scenarios, we always get comments basically indicating that we are obviously not doing this whole parenting thing very well and that with more discipline and authority, his behavior would change. Honestly, I thought that initially, too. And my confidence as a parent went way downhill.”</p>

    <p>Instead, Marco believes, sensory differences should be regarded as a function of brain structure and brain activity that’s guided by both genetic and environmental influences.</p>

    <h2>Indisputable Evidence</h2>

    <p>Marco’s practice is now spilling over with SPD kids like Elias, Xander, and Cal. She also has a significant social media presence on a Facebook page devoted to sensory processing disorders. Her contributions there resonate with the page’s 85,000 members, who are desperate for answers about their children’s seemingly bizarre reactivity. And in her lab, she is scientifically validating the life experience of SPD patients by identifying their brains’ unique structure and function and their distinct genetic profiles. Marco and her team have done so with great success by leveraging leaps in imaging technology and cross-disciplinary partnerships.</p>

    <p>Her lab’s first research breakthroughs were back-to-back papers, published in 2013 and 2014 with UCSF radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD. In the first one, Marco and Mukherjee performed brain-imaging studies on kids with SPD, primarily boys, and compared them against typically developing boys. In the SPD kids, they found abnormal tracts in their white matter, a part of the brain that’s essential for perceiving, thinking, and learning. These tracts connect the auditory, visual, and tactile systems involved in sensory processing. It was the first time researchers had identified a biological basis for SPD.</p>

    <p>In the second study, they compared structural communications in the brains of boys with SPD and boys with autism. They visualized connections among neurons by tracking water moving through the brain’s white matter. When water molecules move in the same direction, connections are thought to be directional and strong, while water going against the flow is a sign of faulty connections.</p>

    <p>“The data was so clear. Kids with sensory processing differences just have different degrees of connection efficiency, particularly in the back part of the brain,” says Marco. This study was the first to show that kids with SPD have quantifiable and distinct differences in brain function. “These kids are not breaking down in school because their parents are doing a bad job or because they are bad kids,” says Marco. “Their brains are wired differently.”</p>

    <p>Marco’s research and social media outreach is now arming parents, teachers, and clinicians all over the country – many of whom had never heard of SPD before – with the tools to diagnose and deliver help to kids earlier. The papers are also a wake-up call for neurologists, pediatricians, family, and friends who have questioned the disorder’s existence – a bittersweet validation of what parents of SPD kids already knew. A diagnosis that stands on hard scientific ground gives parents authority to explain rather than apologize for their kids’ behavior. But more importantly, it gives them license to forgive themselves – to say “I am not crazy,” as Elias’s mom, Cindy, puts it. “And this is not my fault.”</p>

    <h2>A Four-Part Framework</h2>

    <p>That scientific confirmation has shifted the conversation to finding viable treatments. Marco has developed a four-part framework for building a safe, positive world in which SPD kids can thrive. The first two elements – controlling kids’ environment and arousal – help parents figure out how best to structure their children’s physical and emotional surroundings. The third helps kids master healthier reactivity behaviors through brain training. The last helps kids achieve calmness through medications that soften the blows of overstimulation.</p>

    <p>“First, I encourage parents to get an occupational therapist,” recommends Marco, “to help them figure out both at home and at school what environmental changes need to be done to make their lives quiet and consistent. Because it’s the novel stuff that unseats them.” At home, that can be as simple as organizing their room. At school, it can mean putting tennis balls on the legs of chairs so they don’t make sudden sounds as kindergarteners squirm.</p>

    <p>Some schools are more accommodating than others, and parents may find that out the hard way. Kids might be asked to leave a school, or parents might pull them out. “About 25 percent of the kids in my clinic end up in independent schools,” says Marco. Cal is in a small and very structured early intervention program, offered through the public school system, that has been incredibly effective in helping him understand the expectations of a school environment. Other SPD kids, like Xander and Elias, are schooled at home, either online or by teachers who come to them. Marco’s biggest takeaway on school choice is this: You don’t want your child to have post-traumatic stress from a school environment that can’t accommodate them. “Whether your kid is 3, 12, or 18, you need their self-esteem intact,” she says.</p>

    <p>Her treatment plan also calls for a healthy diet free of simple sugars and simple carbs, a regular bedtime, and consistent exercise, all of which help control the arousal levels of kids – and parents. “If parents are out of control, their kids will be. As a simple start, I suggest they take 10 deep breaths if their kids start to escalate.”</p>

      <p>As Silicon Valley trendsetters, famous actors, and online health sites tout the low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic, or “keto,” diet, scientists are working to study it – from how it impacts inflammation in the brain to its effects on weight and heart health, as well as any other potential health risks.</p>

      <p>Among the researchers studying the diet’s effectiveness and safety are Ethan Weiss, MD, and Raymond Swanson, MD, two UC San Francisco physician-scientists who have studied different aspects of the ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet tries to bring carbohydrates down to less than 5 percent of a person’s daily caloric intake.</p>

      <h2>What We Know</h2>

      <p>Swanson, a professor of neurology who has researched the impacts of ketogenic diets on inflammation in the brain, got curious about the ketogenic diet when trying to treat the inflammation that persists for days after a person suffers a stroke. When he tried inducing a ketogenic state in mice with stroke injuries, he said, “I was overwhelmed by the effect.” Blocking glucose metabolism worked to suppress inflammatory genes, which in turn helped stroke healing.</p>

      <p>The anti-inflammatory effect of ketosis on stroke recovery is likely the same effect that helps children with certain kinds of seizures, said Swanson, who is a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. Ketogenic diets have been used as treatment for some forms of epilepsy for almost a century. </p>

      <p>Weiss, an associate professor at the Cardiovascular Research Institute who studies the effects of diet on weight and heart health, has been an adviser for Virta Health Corp., a company that is treating type 2 diabetes by controlling patients’ blood glucose levels through a ketogenic diet.</p>

      <p>“It’s incredibly powerful,” said Weiss of the keto diet. “Cutting back on carbohydrates, there are so many metabolic benefits. The body processes the remaining carbohydrates more efficiently, and so it requires much less insulin.”</p>

      <p>Frederick Hecht, MD, research director of the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, also is performing more trials aimed at people with type 2 diabetes. In the controlled trials, a ketogenic state has shown promise in improving human glucose control and decreasing the need for diabetes medications.</p>

      <h2>What We Don’t Know</h2>

      <p>One big hurdle to the knowledge about the keto diet’s impact on humans is that many of the benefits – helping reduce inflammation in the brain, improving outcomes after brain injury and extending lifespan – have only been found in studies in mice.</p>

      <p>Far fewer clinical studies have been done in humans outside of seizure prevention since ketosis is a difficult state to maintain; avoiding carbs, including fruit, bread, legumes, and the occasional office birthday cake isn’t feasible for many people in the long run.</p>

      <p>Without peer-reviewed clinical trials, many of the benefits remain anecdotal. For instance, Weiss himself has been on a low-carb high-fat (though not strictly ketogenic) diet for more than six months, and claims he does feel much better. But he’s clear about what he knows and what he doesn’t. He’s lost weight and his borderline pre-diabetes is gone.</p>

      <p>“I think I feel great,” he said. But that might be because he’s eating less processed food, sleeping better, or enjoying compliments on his new physique.</p>

      <p>As to the most exotic claims from health and diet gurus – such as keto diets resulting in euphoria, cognitive boosts, and improvements in anything from kidney function to cancer treatment – “We just don’t have the data on that yet,” said Weiss.</p>

      <p>The researchers agree that the diet itself isn’t inherently dangerous. But, cautions Weiss, “If you have any medical condition, if you take any medicine at all – there are lots of things that change how medicines work in our bodies, and nutrition is definitely one of them. If you’re making a real change in your nutrition, you really should talk to your doctor.”</p>
