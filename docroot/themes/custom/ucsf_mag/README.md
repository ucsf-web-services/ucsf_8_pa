# UCSF Magazine Theme
This is a subtheme of ucsf theme, and inherits most of it's styles, you can  [Read the Docs for UCSF Theme](./scss/README.md)

# Prerequisites
You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
this theme has .nvmrc file which means that you can run a command to switch to recommended node version for compiling
```
$ nvm use
```

## Install and start watching for changes
Changing into the `docroot/themes/custom/ucsf_mag` directory, run this to install
dependencies:
```
$ npm ci
```
You may have to run that again for updates. **If you have any problems; this is
the first thing to run.**

### Compile for development
Inside `docroot/themes/custom/ucsf_mag` run following command to do an initial build of the site and start watching for changes while doing
local development:
```
$ npm start
```

### NPM Dependencies
NPM is a Node package manager for the web. It is useful for adding third party
libraries for both development and site inclusion.
Install any [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) component with the `--save` flag. You
can search for anything that NPM can install and run:
    $ npm install {thing} --save
Use `--save` when a package needs to be added as a dependency to the browser.
Use `--save-dev` when a package is only needed for development like Sass
libraries.

# SASS Best Practices
All SASS imports are now done using [@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use)
instead of the older `@import` syntax. This allows all variables and mixins to
be scoped per file.

### Include scss partials
 in this file `docroot/themes/custom/ucsf_mag/scss/style.scss`

compiled css will end up inside
`docroot/themes/custom/ucsf_mag/dist/style.css`

### SCSS Folder structure
`O_tools/_index.scss` is a bundle of all of the variables and mixins that can be
imported into a partial at the same time using `@use "../0_tools" as *;`.

# Folder Structure
```
|-- dist/
|-- images/
|-- js/
|-- node_modules/
|-- sass/
|-- templates/
|-- .nvmrc
|-- .stylelintrc
|-- package-lock.json
|-- package.json
|-- ucsf_mag.info
|-- ucsf_mag.libraries.yml
|-- ucsf_mag.theme
```

## 1. dist/
Sass is compiled into CSS files. Files
in this directory are auto-generated so should never be manually edited. This is
what Drupal looks to for production ready assets.

## 2. images/
Image files like jpeg, gif, png, or svg should be added to this directory.

## 3. js/
Javascript files belong in this directory. A default all.js file is already
available for use. Drupal Behaviors are helpful for
allowing your javascript to work nicely with Drupal and Drupal's Ajax system.
More information on using Javascript in Drupal can be found here: [https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/javascript-api/javascript-api-overview](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/javascript-api/javascript-api-overview)
You can create additional JS files and add them inside `docroot/themes/custom/ucsf_mag/ucsf_mag.libraries.yml`

## 4. node_modules/
This directory does not exist by default, but it will be created automatically
once `npm ci` is run. This directory should never be edited, and it should
not be committed to git.

## 5. sass/
All (S)CSS files should go in this directory.
[Read the Sass Docs](./scss/README.md)

**style.scss**: This is the master file for all scss except files inside "libraries" directory. All partials should be
imported here using [@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).
Styles should ideally go into individual component files rather than directly
into this file. This will compile to `/dist/style.css`.
Variables and mixins are imported in the `O_tools/_index.scss`
file.

**ckeditor.scss**: When using the CKEditor WYSIWYG, it is helpful to see the styles
which will be applied in the actual theme. This file allows styles to be
injected into the editor so that a user gets a better idea of how text and
components like buttons, lists, and links will really look. This
will compile to `/dist/ckeditor.css`.

## 6. templates/
The `templates` directory allows [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) files to be
added so that HTML markup can be overridden or customized. These files end with
`.html.twig`. For example: `block.html.twig` or `node--teaser.html.twig`.
Drupal auto-detects twig files based on [naming conventions](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming/twig/twig-template-naming-conventions).
So if you name a Twig file correctly, Drupal will automatically use it.
In addition, you can suggest templates for use when certain conditions are met.
This link provides documentation for working with Drupal 9 templates:
[https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal/working-with-twig-templates](https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/twig-in-drupal/working-with-twig-templates)

## Files
**nvmrc**: `nvm use` command wil make nvm look for the .nvmrc file to load the specified version of node:

**package-lock.json**: (auto-generated by `npm install`) This is a Lock file so that everyone on your team will
be sure to install the exact same Node packages.

**package.json**: This is the main file used by Node to declare any NPM packages
that will be used and custom scripts. Likely you will not need to edit this
file unless there are specific Node packages you need.

**ucsf_mag.info.yml**: This is the main file which declares a theme to Drupal. It
contains information about the theme, adds libraries,
and declares regions where content can be placed.

**ucsf_mag.libraries.yml**: Libraries for CSS and Javascript can be defined here. These
only inform drupal that the libraries exist, not that they should be used.
More libraries or dependencies can be declared if needed.

**ucsf_mag.theme**: This file is for more advanced users. It allows a developer to
alter Drupal's output before it gets to a Twig template. It uses PHP and Drupal
Hooks to change variables and data that is eventually passed to a template. This
is also where any theme suggestions would be located.
